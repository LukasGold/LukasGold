## Hi there üëã

Welcome to my GitHub profile!  
This space is primarily used for work-related projects. For my personal and hobby projects, please visit [LukasOro](https://github.com/LukasGold).

I'm **Lukas Gold**, a self-taught programmer, scientist, and advocate for **FAIR data** principles. My coding journey began in 2016 with Python and MATLAB, supporting my research in digital signal processing and the analysis of large experimental datasets during my PhD. My doctoral work focused on **ultrasound-aided state estimation of lithium-ion batteries** and **monitoring their production processes**.

Currently, I work as a **Senior Scientist** in the **Department for Digital Transformation** at **Fraunhofer ISC**, where I specialize in automating analytical data processing and designing data infrastructures that enable sustainable and reproducible scientific workflows.

## Vision & Mission üåê

My mission is to **transform how scientific organizations acquire, transfer, and preserve metadata, experimental data, and knowledge**.

Semantic technologies ‚Äî around since the 1990s ‚Äî offer powerful solutions to challenges like data heterogeneity and machine readability. However, their complexity has limited their adoption to large-scale applications, leaving everyday scientific data handling behind.

With the rise of **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, we now have tools that can simplify semantic annotation and contextualization during data entry. This opens the door to broader adoption and more intuitive data management.

I envision a future where we realize the concept of a **"Web of Doing Things"** ‚Äî a dynamic, interoperable ecosystem of scientific data and tools. My goal is to contribute by developing **practical tools and concepts** that bridge the gap between advanced IT solutions and everyday scientific practice.

##  Recent Projects üî¨üöß

- [**Open Semantic Lab (OSL)**](https://github.com/OpenSemanticLab)  
  A knowledge platform that merges wiki-style documentation with semantic descriptions of inventory items, organizational structures, and laboratory processes. Designed to preserve institutional knowledge in (materials) science through a **reusable and adaptable knowledge graph**‚Äîapplicable to both scientific and non-scientific domains.

- [**osw-python**](https://github.com/OpenSemanticLab/osw-python)  
  A Python package for interfacing with Open Semantic Lab. It enables **data import/export**, **documentation of scientific workflows**, and **querying project- or institution-wide knowledge graphs**, supporting FAIR data practices and semantic interoperability.

- [**Object-Oriented Linked Data (OO-LD)**](https://github.com/OO-LD)  
  A conceptual framework that combines **object-oriented programming** with **semantic annotations**, lowering the barrier for developers and scientists to adopt Linked Data technologies. It enables **machine-readable process descriptions** without requiring direct creation of RDF datasets or schemas.

- [**OpenBattTools**](https://github.com/OpenBattTools)  
  A modular toolkit for **electrochemical testing and analysis of batteries**. It aims to establish an **open-source pipeline** for battery data‚Äîfrom test planning and data acquisition to analysis and FAIR-compliant data sharing.
